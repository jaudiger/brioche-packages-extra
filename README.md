# Brioche Packages Extra

This is a sibling repository to the main [Brioche Packages](https://github.com/brioche-dev/brioche-packages) repo. The main difference is packages in this repo aren't automatically published to the Brioche Registry, so these packages can only be used via git!

The bar for accepting contributions in this repo is lower than for the main repo, so it's a better fit for various things:

- Work-in-progress, broken, or unstable packages
- Example projects that might otherwise clutter up the main repo
- Packages that can't or shouldn't be distributed like other Brioche packages (for example: packages that are legally-encumbered due to licensing conflicts, like FFMPEG builds with all features enabled)

When in doubt, feel free to open a Pull Request or Issue for the main [Brioche Packages](https://github.com/brioche-dev/brioche-packages) repo first. If your contribution isn't a good fit, you might be asked to contribute it here instead!
